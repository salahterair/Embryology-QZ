        // Quiz Data: 40 Questions for General Embryology
        const questions = [
            // Question 1 (Day 0)
            {
                question: "What is the process called when the sperm and oocyte combine to form a zygote?",
                options: ["A) Gastrulation", "B) Fertilization", "C) Implantation", "D) Cleavage"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "Fertilization is the fusion of the sperm and oocyte, resulting in the formation of a diploid zygote. This marks the beginning of human development."
            },
            // Question 2 (Week 1)
            {
                question: "The process of rapid cell division without an increase in overall size of the embryo, starting after fertilization, is known as:",
                options: ["A) Implantation", "B) Gastrulation", "C) Cleavage", "D) Neurulation"],
                answer: "C",
                explanation: "Cleavage is a series of mitotic divisions that the zygote undergoes, producing a ball of smaller cells called blastomeres. The size of the embryo remains constant during this phase."
            },
            // Question 3 (Week 1)
            {
                question: "By day 4 of development, the morula enters the uterine cavity and a fluid-filled cavity forms inside it. The structure is now called a:",
                options: ["A) Zygote", "B) Blastocyst", "C) Gastrula", "D) Embryoblast"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "Around day 4, the morula develops a fluid-filled cavity (the blastocyst cavity), transforming it into a blastocyst. The cells differentiate into the inner cell mass (embryoblast) and the outer cell layer (trophoblast)."
            },
            // Question 4 (Week 1)
            {
                question: "The inner cell mass of the blastocyst gives rise to which part of the embryo?",
                options: ["A) The placenta", "B) The chorion", "C) The embryo proper", "D) The yolk sac"],
                answer: "C",
                explanation: "The inner cell mass (embryoblast) is the source of all the cells that will form the embryo itself. The outer cell layer (trophoblast) will contribute to the placenta."
            },
            // Question 5 (Week 2)
            {
                question: "Implantation of the blastocyst into the uterine wall typically begins around what day?",
                options: ["A) Day 1-2", "B) Day 6-7", "C) Day 10-11", "D) Day 14-15"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "Implantation is the process where the blastocyst attaches to and embeds in the endometrium. This typically starts around day 6 or 7 of development."
            },
            // Question 6 (Week 2)
            {
                question: "During the second week, the embryoblast differentiates into a bilaminar germ disc. The two layers are:",
                options: ["A) Ectoderm and endoderm", "B) Epiblast and hypoblast", "C) Trophoblast and amnion", "D) Mesoderm and ectoderm"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "The bilaminar germ disc consists of the epiblast and the hypoblast. The epiblast forms the floor of the amniotic cavity, and the hypoblast forms the roof of the primary yolk sac."
            },
            // Question 7 (Week 3)
            {
                question: "The process of gastrulation, which forms the three primary germ layers, is initiated by the formation of the:",
                options: ["A) Neural plate", "B) Primitive streak", "C) Primitive node", "D) Notochord"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "Gastrulation is a key event in the third week. It begins with the formation of the primitive streak on the surface of the epiblast, which then gives rise to the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm."
            },
            // Question 8 (Week 3)
            {
                question: "The ectoderm gives rise to which of the following structures?",
                options: ["A) The lining of the gut", "B) The heart and blood vessels", "C) The skin and nervous system", "D) The skeleton and muscles"],
                answer: "C",
                explanation: "The ectoderm is the outermost germ layer. It forms the epidermis of the skin, hair, nails, and the entire nervous system (brain and spinal cord)."
            },
            // Question 9 (Week 3)
            {
                question: "The mesoderm gives rise to which of the following structures?",
                options: ["A) The brain and spinal cord", "B) The liver and pancreas", "C) The muscles, bones, and circulatory system", "D) The lining of the respiratory tract"],
                answer: "C",
                explanation: "The mesoderm is the middle germ layer. It forms the connective tissues, muscles, bone, cartilage, kidneys, and the circulatory system (heart and blood vessels)."
            },
            // Question 10 (Week 3)
            {
                question: "The endoderm gives rise to which of the following structures?",
                options: ["A) The brain and spinal cord", "B) The epidermis", "C) The skeletal muscles", "D) The lining of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts"],
                answer: "D",
                explanation: "The endoderm is the innermost germ layer. It forms the epithelial lining of the digestive tract, respiratory tract, and various organs like the liver, pancreas, and urinary bladder."
            },
            // Question 11 (Week 4)
            {
                question: "During the fourth week, the flat trilaminar disc folds into a more cylindrical, three-dimensional embryo. This process is called:",
                options: ["A) Neurulation", "B) Gastrulation", "C) Organogenesis", "D) Embryonic folding"],
                answer: "D",
                explanation: "Embryonic folding is a critical event that transforms the flat embryonic disc into a recognizable human form. It involves folding along both the head-tail axis and the lateral axis."
            },
            // Question 12 (Week 4)
            {
                question: "The process of neurulation, which forms the neural tube, is initiated by the thickening of the ectoderm to form the:",
                options: ["A) Neural plate", "B) Notochord", "C) Primitive streak", "D) Neural node"],
                answer: "A",
                explanation: "Neurulation is the formation of the neural tube, which will become the central nervous system. It begins with the thickening of the ectoderm above the notochord to form the neural plate."
            },
            // Question 13 (Week 4)
            {
                question: "The neural crest cells are a population of cells that detach from the neural tube and migrate throughout the embryo. They give rise to which of the following?",
                options: ["A) The central nervous system", "B) The heart and blood vessels", "C) The peripheral nervous system and melanocytes", "D) The liver and pancreas"],
                answer: "C",
                explanation: "Neural crest cells are often called the 'fourth germ layer' because they are highly migratory and give rise to a wide variety of cell types, including most of the peripheral nervous system and pigment-producing melanocytes."
            },
            // Question 14 (Week 4)
            {
                question: "Around the end of the fourth week, the heart starts to beat. At this stage, the heart is a single tubular structure formed from:",
                options: ["A) Epiblast", "B) Cardiogenic mesoderm", "C) Endoderm", "D) Neural crest cells"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "The heart originates from the cardiogenic mesoderm. It begins as a pair of tubes that fuse to form a single heart tube, which starts beating around day 22-23."
            },
            // Question 15 (Replaced with placental abnormality question)
            {
                question: "A condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the internal cervical os, leading to bleeding late in pregnancy, is known as:",
                options: ["A) Placenta accreta", "B) Placenta previa", "C) Abruptio placentae", "D) Villi-less placenta"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "Placenta previa is the abnormal implantation of the placenta in the lower uterine segment, where it lies over or close to the cervix. It is a major cause of painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester."
            },
            // Question 16 (Week 5)
            {
                question: "What is a key developmental feature of the embryo during the fifth week?",
                options: ["A) Formation of the blastocyst", "B) Rapid growth of the head and formation of the limb buds", "C) Onset of gastrulation", "D) Completion of neurulation"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "During the fifth week, the head grows rapidly, and the upper and lower limb buds become clearly visible as small swellings on the lateral body wall."
            },
            // Question 17 (Replaced with placental abnormality question)
            {
                question: "In a condition called Placenta accreta, the placenta's chorionic villi attach directly to which layer of the uterine wall?",
                options: ["A) Myometrium", "B) Endometrium", "C) Perimetrium", "D) Cervical canal"],
                answer: "A",
                explanation: "Placenta accreta occurs when the chorionic villi invade the myometrium (the muscular layer of the uterine wall) instead of attaching to the endometrium. This can lead to severe complications during childbirth."
            },
            // Question 18 (Week 6)
            {
                question: "What is the name of the process by which the embryo's developing organs begin to take shape from the three primary germ layers?",
                options: ["A) Fertilization", "B) Cleavage", "C) Gastrulation", "D) Organogenesis"],
                answer: "D",
                explanation: "Organogenesis is the process by which the three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) differentiate and interact to form the various organs of the body. It occurs primarily from weeks 3 to 8."
            },
            // Question 19 (Week 7)
            {
                question: "During the seventh week, the umbilical hernia is a normal physiological event where the rapidly growing intestines temporarily protrude into the umbilical cord. This is due to:",
                options: ["A) Lack of space in the abdominal cavity", "B) A genetic defect", "C) A placental abnormality", "D) Improper embryonic folding"],
                answer: "A",
                explanation: "The abdominal cavity is too small to contain the rapidly growing intestines during the seventh and eighth weeks. The intestines temporarily enter the umbilical cord, a process that is a normal part of development."
            },
            // Question 20 (Week 7)
            {
                question: "Separation of the developing digits (fingers and toes) occurs during the seventh and eighth weeks through a process known as:",
                options: ["A) Apoptosis (programmed cell death)", "B) Mitosis", "C) Meiosis", "D) Fertilization"],
                answer: "A",
                explanation: "The webbing between the developing digits is removed through apoptosis, or programmed cell death. This ensures the formation of separate fingers and toes."
            },
            // Question 21 (Week 8)
            {
                question: "By the end of the eighth week, the embryo is often called a fetus. What is a key characteristic of this transition?",
                options: ["A) The embryo is only a few cells large", "B) The major organ systems have begun to form", "C) The placenta is fully developed", "D) The heart has not yet started to beat"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "The embryonic period (weeks 3-8) is characterized by the formation of all major organ systems (organogenesis). By the end of this period, the embryo has a distinctly human appearance, and the major body structures are in place, marking the end of the most critical period of development."
            },
            // Question 22 (Week 8)
            {
                question: "The fetal period begins at which week of development?",
